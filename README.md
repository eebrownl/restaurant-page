Goals for the project: 

1. Become fluent with ES6 modules
2. Use Webpack to bundle all assets and modules
3. Increase competence in DOM manipulation by generating everything in JS with only a container div in the HTML

This project was really delightful. I feel that it gave me a real appreciation for how easy to use ES6 modules are and how they really help keep your code clean and organized. 

The DOM manipulation felt surprisingly easy. I wrote everything in HTML first, then did the styling, then commented out the HTML and generated everything in a unique module for each tab.

The Webpack aspect was also easier than I expected. Every once in a while I would struggle when it would throw an error I couldn't find, but I realized that every time that happened it was a silly JS syntax error. 

The project went well and and I definitely achieved all of the original goals.
